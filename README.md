# Forecasting Net Prophet

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Forecasting Net Prophet project. The goal of this project is to analyze the financial and user data of MercadoLibre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America, and explore the relationship between search traffic and stock price patterns. Additionally, the project aims to create time series models to forecast search traffic and revenue.

The project is divided into four main steps and an optional fifth step:

## Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

In this step, the focus is on analyzing hourly Google search traffic for MercadoLibre. The goal is to identify any unusual patterns in the data and connect them to corporate financial events. The analysis includes slicing the data for the month of May 2020 and comparing the search traffic during that month to the monthly median across all months.

## Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality

The objective of this step is to mine the search traffic data for predictable seasonal patterns. The analysis involves grouping the hourly search data by the day of the week and visualizing the average traffic using a heatmap. Additionally, the search data is grouped by the week of the year to investigate if search traffic tends to increase during the winter holiday period.

## Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns

This step explores the relationship between search traffic and stock price patterns. The analysis includes plotting the stock price data and concatenating it with the search data in a single DataFrame. The data is sliced to the first half of 2020, and the trends in both time series are examined. Additionally, lagged search traffic is introduced, along with columns for stock volatility and hourly stock return. The time series correlation is reviewed to determine if a predictable relationship exists between search traffic and stock volatility or stock price returns.

## Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet

In this step, a time series model using Prophet is created to analyze and forecast patterns in the hourly search data. The process involves setting up the search data for the Prophet forecasting model, estimating the model, and plotting the forecast. The individual time series components of the model are also visualized to answer questions about the popularity of MercadoLibre at different times of the day and week, as well as identifying the lowest point for search traffic in the calendar year.

## Step 5 (Optional): Forecast Revenue by Using Time Series Models

The optional fifth step focuses on forecasting revenue using time series models. Historical sales data is read in, and a Prophet model is applied to identify any seasonal patterns in the company's revenue. The output of the model is interpreted to determine peak revenue days and provide a sales forecast for the next quarter. Best- and worst-case scenarios are also included to assist in budget planning and investor expectations.

Please refer to the individual sections and their respective sub-sections for detailed instructions and code implementation for each step of the project.

Note: The code and analysis in this repository are specific to the forecasting analysis of MercadoLibre and may not be applicable directly to other datasets or scenarios.
